# Africa-malaria-analysis
## Introduction
This analysis presents an indepth look at malaria in African countries, focusing on various factors that influence its spread and control. It brings together information on health interventions, population dynamics, and access to essential services such as water and sanitation. The dataset covers multiple years and regions, allowing for the exploration of trends and patterns related to malaria across the continent.

By combining health, demographic, and environmental data, the dataset offers valuable insights into the challenges and progress in the fight against malaria in Africa. It serves as a useful resource for policymakers, researchers, and health organizations aiming to understand and address the burden of malaria more effectively.
